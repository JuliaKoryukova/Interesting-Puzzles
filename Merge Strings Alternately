Посимвольное соединение строк.

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        
        word = ''

        if len(word1) >= len(word2):
            for i in range (len(word2)):
                word += word1[i]
                word += word2[i]
    
            word += word1[len(word2):]
        else:
            for i in range (len(word1)):
                word += word1[i]
                word += word2[i]
        
            word += word2[len(word1):]
        #word += '"'
        return(word)
